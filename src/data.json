        "<p>Villa Savoye (French pronunciation: ​[sa.vwa]) is a modernist villa in Poissy, on the outskirts of Paris, France. It was designed by Swiss architects Le Corbusier and his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, and built between 1928 and 1931 using reinforced concrete.<p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/villa-savoye/villa-savoye_01.jpg\" alt=\"villa-savoye\"><p>The house was originally built as a country retreat on behest of the Savoye family. After being purchased by the neighbouring school it passed on to be property of the French state in 1958, and after surviving several plans of demolition, it was designated as an official French historical monument in 1965 (a rare occurrence, as Le Corbusier was still living at the time). It was thoroughly renovated from 1985 to 1997, and under the care of the Centre des monuments nationaux, the refurbished house is now open to visitors year-round.</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/villa-savoye/villa-savoye_02.jpg\" alt=\"villa-savoye\"><p>The Villa Savoye is probably Corbusier's best known building from the 1930s, and it had enormous influence on international modernism. It was designed addressing his emblematic \"Five Points\", the basic tenets in his new architectural aesthetic</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/villa-savoye/villa-savoye_03.jpg\" alt=\"villa-savoye\"><p>Unlike his earlier town villas Corbusier was able to carefully design all four sides of the Villa Savoye in response to the view and the orientation of the sun. On the ground floor he placed the main entrance hall, ramp and stairs, garage, chauffeur and maid's rooms. At first floor the master bedroom, the son's bedroom, guest bedroom, kitchen, salon and external terraces. The salon was oriented to the south east whilst the terrace faced the east. The son's bedroom faced the north west and the kitchen and service terrace were on the south west. At second floor level were a series of sculpted spaces that formed a solarium.</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/villa-savoye/villa-savoye_04.jpg\" alt=\"villa-savoye\"><p>Problems with the Savoyes caused by all the requests for additional payment from the contractors for all the changes were compounded by the requirement for early repairs to the new house. Each autumn the Savoyes suffered problems with rainwater leaks through the roof. By refusing downpipes and sills which would interrupt their aesthetic, the white surfaces were more susceptible to staining and erosion due to the water pour-down. Additionally, these building was also scarred with cracks because the material was not designed for structural durability. The Savoyes continued to live in the house until 1940, leaving during World War II. It was occupied twice during the war: first by the Germans – when it was used as a hay store – and then by the Americans, with both occupations damaging the building severely. The Savoyes returned to their estate after the war, but, no longer in position to live as they had done before the war, they abandoned the house again shortly after. The villa was expropriated by the town of Poissy in 1958, which first used it as a public youth center and later considered demolishing it to make way for a schoolhouse complex. Protest from architects who felt the house should be saved, and the intervention of Corbusier himself, spared the house from demolition. A first attempt of restoration was begun in 1963 by architect Jean Debuisson, despite opposition from Corbusier. The villa was added to the French register of historical monuments in 1965, becoming the first modernist building designated as historical monument in France, and also the first to be the object of restoration while its architect was still living. In 1985, a thorough state-funded restoration process, led by architect Jean-Louis Véret, was undertaken, being completed in 1997. The restoration included structural and surface repairs to the facades and terraces because of deterioration of the concrete, the installation of lighting and security cameras, and the reinstatement of some of the original fixtures and fittings.</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/villa-savoye/villa-savoye_05.jpg\" alt=\"villa-savoye\"><p class=\"text-right\">Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Savoye\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a></p>"

        "<p>Fallingwater is a house designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright in 1935 in rural southwestern Pennsylvania, 43 miles (69 km) southeast of Pittsburgh. The house was built partly over a waterfall on Bear Run in the Mill Run section of Stewart Township, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, located in the Laurel Highlands of the Allegheny Mountains. The house was designed as a weekend home for the family of Liliane Kaufmann and her husband, Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr., owner of Kaufmann's Department Store.<p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/fallingwater/fallingwater_01.jpg\" alt=\"Fallingwater\"><p>After its completion, Time called Fallingwater Wright's \"most beautiful job,\" and it is listed among Smithsonian's \"Life List of 28 places to visit before you die.\" The house was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966. In 1991, members of the American Institute of Architects named Fallingwater the \"best all-time work of American architecture\" and in 2007, it was ranked 29th on the list of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA.</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/fallingwater/fallingwater_02.jpg\" alt=\"Fallingwater\"><p>At age 67, Frank Lloyd Wright was given the opportunity to design and construct three buildings. With his three works of the late 1930s—Fallingwater; the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin; and the Herbert Jacobs house in Madison, Wisconsin—Wright regained his prominence in the architectural community.</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/fallingwater/fallingwater_03.jpg\" alt=\"Fallingwater\"><p>Fallingwater was the family's weekend home from 1937 until 1963, when Edgar Kaufmann Jr. donated the property to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. The family retreated at Fallingwater on weekends to escape the heat and smoke of industrial Pittsburgh. Liliane enjoyed swimming in the nude and collecting modern art, especially the works of Diego Rivera, who was a guest at the country house.</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/fallingwater/fallingwater_04.jpg\" alt=\"Fallingwater\"><p>Fallingwater stands as one of Wright's greatest masterpieces both for its dynamism and for its integration with its striking natural surroundings. Fallingwater has been described as an architectural tour de force of Wright's organic architecture. Wright's passion for Japanese architecture was strongly reflected in the design of Fallingwater, particularly in the importance of interpenetrating exterior and interior spaces and the strong emphasis placed on harmony between man and nature. Contemporary Japanese architect Tadao Ando has said of the house: \"I think Wright learned the most important aspect of architecture, the treatment of space, from Japanese architecture. When I visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, I found that same sensibility of space. But there was the additional sounds of nature that appealed to me.\"</p><img class=\"img-responsive center-block modal-img\" src=\"img/fallingwater/fallingwater_05.jpg\" alt=\"Fallingwater\"><p class=\"text-right\">Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallingwater\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a></p>"

It's also called placeholder (or filler) text. It's a convenient tool for mock-ups. It helps to outline the visual elements of a document or presentation, eg typography, font, or layout. Lorem ipsum is mostly a part of a Latin text by the classical author and philosopher Cicero. Its words and letters have been changed by addition or removal, so to deliberately render its content nonsensical; it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While <strong>lorem ipsum</strong>'s still resembles classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.</p><p>In a professional context it often happens that private or corporate clients corder a publication to be made and presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its elements. Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments. <strong>Lorem ipsum</strong> and its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth century.</p><img class=\"img-responsive modal-img\" src=\"http://via.placeholder.com/640x360/223550/fff?text=SVG\" alt=\"layout based on Lorem Ipsum\" title=\"layout based on Lorem Ipsum\"><p>Most of its text is made up from sections 1.10.32–3 of Cicero's De finibus bonorum et malorum (On the Boundaries of Goods and Evils; finibus may also be translated as purposes). Neque porro quisquam est qui do<strong>lorem ipsum</strong> quia <strong>dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci</strong> v<strong>elit</strong> is the first known version (\"Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it\"). It was found by Richard McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he searched for citings of consectetur in classical Latin literature, a term of remarkably low frequency in that literary corpus.</p>"
